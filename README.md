# Backend Examples

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide some examples and templates of backend programming for others (and myself) to use. 
You are free to take, use, and improve upon the code that is provided. I hope this helps get you started.

## Layout
Currently separated into different programming languages. I will try to add more languages as I also learn. Each section will have its own README that further shows what that particular folder contains. Each example should provide instructions on how to run the code for use.

## Languages:
- Golang
- NodeJS
- Terraform (HCL)
- Python (coming soon)

Future plan is to have the same examples written in multiple programming languages or with differnet frameworks.
